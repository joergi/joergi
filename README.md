### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I will move many of my open-source projects to Codeberg.
I'm doing it with the GitHub repo [migrate_github_repo_to_codeberg](https://github.com/joergi/migrate_github_repo_to_codeberg)
The original is of course on my [Codeberg -> joergi/migrate_github_repo_to_codeberg](https://codeberg.org/joergi/migrate_github_repo_to_codeberg)
